# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks a lot for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we really appreciate your help. Take a look through this document to make sure we can give you a great
experience with your contribution.


## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We're always happy to hear about any bugs or features requests using GitHub issues.

When filing an issue, please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment


## Contributing via Pull Requests
Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.
4. 4. You are not mixing substantial refactoring changes in with functional changes.
   1. If refactoring is desirable, publish a separate refactoring PR first, followed by a functional change PR. This will ensure safe and efficient reviews.
   2. PRs that do not meet these expectations will be rejected.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.
7. Please do not squash commits between revisions, this makes review challenging, as the diff between revisions is harder to find and review.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).


## Finding contributions to work on
Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As this is a repository for experimenting
and trying out new integrations, there may be few open issues filed but we're always happy to add more test apps for
different frameworks.
