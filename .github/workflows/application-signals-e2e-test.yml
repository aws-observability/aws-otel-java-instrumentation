  # This validation is to ensure that all test workflows relevant to this repo are actually
  # being used in this repo, which is referring to all the other jobs in this file.
  #
  # If this starts failing, then it most likely means that new e2e test workflow was
  # added to `aws-observability/aws-application-signals-test-framework`, but was not
  # added to this file. It could also mean that a test in this file has been removed.
  #
  # If a particular test file is intended to not be tested in this repo and should not
  # be failing this particular validation, then choose one of the following options:
  # - Add the test file to the exclusions input (CSV format) to the workflow
  #   (see: https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-application-signals-test-framework/blob/main/.github/workflows/validate-e2e-tests-are-accounted-for.yml#L1)
  # - Update the `validate-e2e-tests-are-accounted-for` job to change which "workflow files are expected to be used by this repo"
