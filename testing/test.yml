## This workflow aims to run the Application Signals end-to-end tests to test changes
## on the E2E testing resources before submitting a PR. The e2e-eks-test will deploy a
## sample app on an EKS cluster, call the APIs, and validate the generated telemetry
## including logs, metrics, and traces while the e2e-ec2-test will do the same but on
## two EC2 instances.
