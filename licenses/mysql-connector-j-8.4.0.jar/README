Notice:
- In order to use the logging capabilities provided by the default
  implementation com.mysql.cj.log.Slf4JLogger, it is required to add one or
  more jars for Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) to your CLASSPATH.
- To use the X DevAPI features in Connector/J, you also need the external
  library protobuf-java, which you can download manually from the official
  Maven repository and add it to the CLASSPATH, or use Maven's automatic
  dependency resolution features by adding a dependency to "GroupId: com.mysql"
  and "ArtifactId: mysql-connector-j" to your project's pom.xml file.
- To use OCI AIM authentication, you will need to add the external library
  oci-java-sdk-common, which you can download manually from the official Maven
  repository and add it to the CLASSPATH, or use Maven's automatic dependency
  resolution features by adding a dependency to "GroupId: com.oracle.oci.sdk"
  and "ArtifactId: oci-java-sdk-common" to your project's pom.xml file.
