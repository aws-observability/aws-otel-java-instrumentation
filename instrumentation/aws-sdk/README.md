## ADOT AWS SDK Instrumentation

### Overview
The aws-sdk instrumentation is an SPI-based implementation that extends the upstream OpenTelemetry AWS Java SDK instrumentation.

_Initialization Workflow_

1. OpenTelemetry Agent starts
   - Loads default instrumentations
   - Loads aws-sdk instrumentation from opentelemetry-java-instrumentation
   - Registers **TracingExecutionInterceptor** (order = 0)
2. Scans for other SPI implementations
   - Finds ADOTâ€™s **AdotAwsSdkInstrumentationModule**
   - Registers **AdotAwsSdkTracingExecutionInterceptor** (order > 0)

### AWS SDK v2 Instrumentation Summary

**AdotAwsSdkInstrumentationModule**

The AdotAwsSdkInstrumentationModule registers the AdotAwsSdkTracingExecutionInterceptor in `registerHelperResources`.

Key aspects of interceptor registration:
- AWS SDK's ExecutionInterceptor loads global interceptors from files named '/software/amazon/awssdk/global/handlers/execution.interceptors' in the classpath
- Interceptors are executed in the order they appear in the classpath - earlier entries run first
- `order` method ensures ADOT instrumentation runs after OpenTelemetry's base instrumentation, maintaining proper sequence of interceptor registration in AWS SDK classpath

**AdotAwsSdkTracingExecutionInterceptor**

The AdotAwsSdkTracingExecutionInterceptor hooks onto OpenTelemetry's spans during specific phases of the SDK request and response life cycle. These hooks are strategically chosen to ensure proper ordering of attribute injection.

1. `beforeTransmission`: the latest point where the SDK request can be obtained after it is modified by the upstream's interceptor
2. `modifyResponse`: the latest point to access the SDK response before the span closes in the upstream afterExecution method

_**Important Note:**_
The upstream interceptor closes the span in `afterExecution`. That hook is inaccessible for span modification.
`modifyResponse` is our final hook point, giving us access to both the fully processed response and active span.
